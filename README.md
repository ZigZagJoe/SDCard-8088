<h2>AVR-based SD card interface</h2>
for processors with a parallel interface, such as the 8088 or 68008<br><br>
many improvements could be made with the benefit of hindsight - use ASM, a better SD library<br>
big one- use of GAL rather than discrete 74LS* logic - suspect I might have had issues interfacing<br>
I will revisit this project at some point.<br>
